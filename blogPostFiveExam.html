		<h2>Data Visualisation, Art, and Representation </h2>

		<section class = "blog_post" slot="e-content recent posts" aria-roledescription="blog entries">
			<p class = "blog1_text">
				What is the relationship between Data Visualisation and Data Art? Also, what are the strategies used to represent this in the best way possible? These questions are the premise of this essay and in this essay, we will discuss the answer to these questions and discover why it is important that these questions are answered.
			</p>
			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Let’s define Data visualisation. Firstly, we know that according to Tableau Data visualisation is defined as “Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.” (Tableau, n.d.). now let us define Data Art. According to Kirell Benzi “Data Art or data-driven art is an artistic practice that relies on the usage of a dataset to convey emotions to the audience. Because it is based on data, the piece has a more objective truth behind its construction and does not solely come from the artist's imagination.” (Benzi, 2020) 
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Using these two definitions we can see that both work with the key element being data and the representation of it. As we see from the definitions that we have received, data visualisation represents data in a sort of maths format, meaning that when a certain set of data is received that data is represented by a chart such as a pie chart or a bar graph whereas data art takes that data set and uses it to produce a set of emotion-provoking art similar to a painting or some form of creative medium. These methods of displaying data are used to better understand it and understand it for people to interact with it and see and understand what they are interacting with and why they are interacting with it.
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Using the understanding that I have built of data visualisation I see that the reason it is used and represented as graphs is for the sake of condensing data from a large sample that is confusing into an easier format that can be used for comparing and understanding to make knowledge creation and comparative analyses.  If the data set is purely raw information, it is harder to graph what the data is showing you and to understand the data set’s point. Whereas we see that by using a graph all that information is shown in an easy way that helps us use the data for research or understanding. This is also seen in the reading “Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics” (Wattenberg, n.d.) by Fernanda Viegas and Martin Wattenburg where they first talk about and state data visualisations’ scientific background. They also talk about the use of data visualisation as an artistic tool and how the artist uses and bends the rules of visualisation to create meaningful artwork that corresponds to the data. They talk about the use of art that makes the data lets confusing when it’s all plotted onto a single graph and instead expanding it into an art that shows it differently. This is one of the ways that data visualisation links in with data art.
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Data art as we see in the definition, I have found is the use of a data set to make art that conveys emotion and meaning to the people that view it. This is used to mould the data set into a more digestible format that not only looks good but is also thought-provoking and has the specific purpose of bringing awareness to the data set and its meaning. Data art helps in visual communication as people see how data is represented and they can understand and make meaning by looking at the artwork and formulating their thoughts, feeling and experiences of what the data means to them. We see this in “Representation” (Kidd, 2015) by J. Kidd where they talk about Representation and Visual communication. This is where they talk about images and the use of images to convey meaning and communicate to the viewer. They also have a chapter on Representation and Reality and how the representation of something demonstrates its meaning. One can think of this as the Sign and Signifier that is talked about by Stuart Hall.
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
                In this section, Kidd talks about how language is used to make the concept of reality in which we currently operate. Kidd talks about the connection between reality and words and how words create our reality instead of the reality always existing before it was given a name. Kidd describes the linguistic sign as arbitrary saying that there isn’t a connection between the way a word looks and the way it is written as well as the connection between what the word describes. Kidd talks about semiotics as it is the study of signs and the use of those signs as an interpretation of something. Kidd talks about how signs are used to interpret meaning and understanding and how signs become the construction of the reality of the things they represent.
			</p>
		
		
			<p class = "blog1_text">
                Kidd then talks about a new section which is representation and myth, and this describes the use of representation which was used in history to provide visuals of things that existed or are thought to have existed in older generations. Kidd talks about how the apple logo is used to signify something and how the look and poster generated meaning as now the logo is associated with and represents a big cooperation. This section is also linked with the signs of creatures that are myths such as Egypt’s representation of the Sphinx which is a mythical creature that they believe to have existed in ancient times. They have made statues and given them a name this represents this creature and in turn, this creature became a reality using signifiers and representation or else it would not have been known. Kidd talks about how the use of signs layer up and so certain messages that are produced become normalised and natural meaning that they appear often enough that we do not notice them anymore.

                Lastly, as data art, I would like to talk about Techno-Art (Roeser, 2016). This deals with the newer generations of technology that have come out in recent years due to the rapid development of technology currently we have seen the rise of many digital creations as using technology the production of art and meaning in terms of art has become very easy to produce and so it has popped up a lot more often. Since the rise of technology techno-art has become a major thing as now many artists are interested in the creation of art using technology as their basis. Since the inception of techno-art, we see that it provides a deeper potential to create experiences and incite emotion from people as now the use of technology creates whole worlds that can be experienced in one spot an example of this is games that are a form of art that show whole worlds, stories and characters that have their arcs and progression that tell interesting and meaningful stories that carry loads of emotion. I have seen recently there has been a debate that technology takes away the novelty of art and meaning as machines are cold, non-thinking and non-living objects that are used to supplement humans in some cases and so the debate is if machines can produce any meaningful art of culture that produces emotional sensitivity and understanding of deeper concepts and human emotions.


			</p>
		
			<p class = "blog1_text">
                It is widely believed that by using technology one-day humans will become cold and unfeeling as well. This all correlates to the use and representation of data art and data visualisation as we see how data is used and transformed between different mediums and how this translation can provoke feelings and emotions out of someone when it is made to be artistic and when it is made to be scientific through visualisation, we can get a deeper understanding of data in which we see the meaning of data and what the data provided in terms of results and meaning. We see how the two subjects fit within one another as data art like data visualisation can be used visually to help aid in scientific meaning and understanding and vice versa data visualisation can be used to provide data art that provokes emotions and thoughts about certain data and subject matter. 
			</p>

            <p class = "blog1_text">
                Through the process of reading and understanding, I’ve realised once again the potential and understanding that can be provided through data art and data visualisation and that the creation if meaning sometimes needs a different perspective to provide that. When having visual elements to rely upon one a part of our brain activates that finds this way of digesting data more pleasing as we can grasp concepts easier and see analyses better as we have visuals to compare two data sets. This also helps with comparing data sets as now we can see how the sets provide a differing visual experience as both have their values and meaning so we can see two sets correlate to one another and how and experiment or something like that affects the data in which we receive.
