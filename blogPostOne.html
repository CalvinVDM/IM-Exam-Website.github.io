		<h2>Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation </h2>

				What is Data Visualization and what does Chapter 2 Overview of data
                visualization (Li, 2020) by Li, Q tell us about it? The reading tells us
                the history of data visualization dates to the 2nd century AD and those
                ancient societies used them to record and perceive data such as historic
                events and investigate this that they did not understand in the world
                around them. Due to the evolution of technology and the advancement of
                human understanding and recording the way data visualization is
                represented today has changed.
			</p>
			<p class = "blog1_text">
				The main representation of this is the computing devices we use today.
				They have the ability of processing and capture data in efficient and
				accurate ways that have vastly aided us in investigation and record
				making. This is seen in the way we use computers for data visualization we
				use them to make graphs that help us represent and compare data if
				efficient ways that show us visually the comparison between sets of data.
				This is seen in line graphs and bar graphs as well as pie charts which are
				examples of the format that we use to store and represent this data. The
				forming and imaging that is created on these graphs are now done by
				computers that help us efficiently input and process the data for
				comparison.
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				What is the definition of Data Visualization? The reading says most
      			definitions focus on the connection between data and computing technology
      			for it to be processed as visual or audio formats (Li, 2020). Data
      			visualization according to the research I’ve done means that the broadest
      			sense means the representation of the information using visual elements
      			for people to see and interact with using their vision (Tableau, n.d.).
      			Using this definition helps one to think of data visualization in a
      			broader sense since this does not focus on the computing ability of
      			technology to depict data as now using drawing and other visual elements
      			become a viable use of data visualization although I would still consider
      			the use of digital elements to be the main way of providing data
      			visualization in the present.
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				“How do we define Data and Information?” is the next thing discussed in
     			 the reading. In the reading, the first definition of data is that it is
      			raw, unprocessed information that is not recognized as having any meaning.
     			 I agree with is information because through this definition we understand
      			that there are a lot of types of data and that these data types only come
      			to have meaning once they are firstly put in context and secondly, they
     			 are processed. What is further interesting is the fact the data is not
      			defined as digital meaning that data is not reliant on computing devices
      			to be data, but these computing devices still use data for processing.
      			Data can be defined as “Facts that can be analyzed or used to gain
      			knowledge or make decisions; information.” (YourDictionary, n.d.).
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				The forms of traditional Data Visualization refer to the formats and
				things we use to store and see data. These forms show how we usually
				represent data in many different visual ways that help us perceive and
				process the data differently. “The common forms for information
				visualization involve Tables, Charts, Trees, Maps, Scatter plots,
				Diagrams, and Graphs, as indicated in the table” (Li, 2020) these
				representations are useful when doing information synthesis and
				visualization meaning that they are used to help sort out factual data and
				number for example. In scientific visualization, they make use of
				different forms of representation that better suit their needs and
				analysis of the data as sometimes data cannot be processed in the same way
				to represent the same things or different things. This means that
				sometimes another form of representation is used to suit the data and make
				the data more digestible and easier for processing. “There are more
				specific forms of data visualization, such as area chart, bar chart,
				bullet graph, Box-and-whisker Plots, Bubble Cloud, Cartogram, Circle View,
				Dot Distribution Map, Gantt Chart, Heat Map, Highlight Table, Histogram,
				Matrix, Network, Polar Area, Radial Tree, Streamgraph, Text Tables,
				Treemap, Wedge Stack Graph, and Word Cloud” (Li, 2020) these are the types
				that are used in scientific visualization.

			<h2>Tree graphs</h2>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
			  These are used by showing the root of information meaning where it started
			  and how it develops into other things. This can be used for things like
			  probability by showing the different routes probability can take
			</p>
		
			<h2>Maps</h2>
		
			<p class = "blog1_text">
			  These are forms of digital representation that show use the graphical
			  location of things as well as indicate the layout of the land.
			</p>
		
			<h2>Scatter Plots</h2>
		
			<p class = "blog1_text">
			  They are used to represent a lot of information and draw a line through
			  the dots that each show data of a specific thing the lines represent the
			  average between all these plots.
			</p>
		
			<h2>Charts</h2>
		
			<p class = "blog1_text">
			  They are 2 dimensional and indicate data usually on access or like a pie
			  chart they compare data against other sets of data. The scatter plot above
			  represents a chart.
			</p>
		
			<h2>Tables</h2>
		
			<p class = "blog1_text">
			  Used to represent many types of data on one thing like how each row shows
			  information about one thing and compares it to another row.
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				These are some examples of data Visualization. Each relies on different
                visual aspects to process the data for analysis and research. The reading
      			shows us that the way we as humans see things can help us to understand
      			and investigate certain things in a better fashion that is more suited to
      			our ability to process information. This shows how our brains are faster
      			at picking up certain information and processing things better if we lay
      			out the information in a certain way. The visualization of this
      			information makes it easier to process and understand if we use the data
      			and represents it in more digestible ways for our brain as if we were to
      			take in the raw information.
