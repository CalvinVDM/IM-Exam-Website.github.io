		<h2>Close Reading - Interaction for Data Visualisation</h2>

		<section class = "blog_post" slot="e-content recent posts" aria-roledescription="blog entries">
			<p class = "blog1_text">
				The reading “What is interaction for Data Visualisation” (Evanthia Dimara, 2020) by Dimara and 
                Perin was very confusing, and I did not understand the reading while going through the work. The 
                reading starts by talking about the interactions between people and a data system for 
                communication but 9i don’t think I completely understand what is meant by that.
			</p>
			<p class = "blog1_text">
                In the reading, the interaction for data visualization is described as “Interaction for visualization is 
                the interplay between a person and a data interface involving a data-related intent, at least one 
                action from the person and an interface reaction is perceived as such.” (Vimeo, 2019). When I read 
                this definition, I could only describe it as the input of a person and output of a data system, which 
                means that this process is perceived as the “Interaction of data Visualisation”. This makes sense to 
                be as I describe interaction as when I think of interaction, I imagine it as the process of trading 
                actions between 2 things to receive a result. So, to be in terms of data visualization I would imagine
                that the interaction is the user/person using a data system to get an output of some kind that is 
                related to the data.
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				In the reading, they say that they came out with this definition by firstly collecting research papers. 
                All these papers have something to do with interaction and they opted for the critical review of
                these books instead of the systematic view this allowed for a more non-biased compilation of 
                information, and it allows for the work to be objective and have greater accuracy. To gain greater 
                criticality for the work the author set rules for themselves being that firstly that the view of 
                interaction must be by experts. Secondly, they shouldn’t use snowballing meaning following the intext references because those references will be biasedly selected. Lastly, all reviews and 
                information complied must use HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) papers that include visualization.

			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
                To help compile and gather information the set questionnaires that asked specifically for definitions 
                of the topic of the interaction of visualization, the paper must be relevant to interaction, they must 
                be experienced in the topic and lastly, they must communicate their experience on the topic as in 
                how often they come across it. They also added tags that asked for specific criteria and this narrows 
                the pool of replies to specific people that can give valuable information on the topic with 
                unbiasedness. I think that this is a great method of complying with information through a 
                questionnaire as it makes the most relevant data of the group come through easier with these 
                specifications.
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Using this information, the synthesis of a view of interaction is a visualization from the narroweddown sources. They identified that interaction was seen as an overload and elusive term to get a 
                solid definition on, so they narrowed their information down further with the tags. They found that 
                interaction of Visualization must include a user and data, so they added this to its definition. 
                Through further research, they saw that the interaction of visualization can include external and 
                internal entities as well as additional internal and external actions. I would describe this as part of 
                the “Process” of turning an input into output which means that the synthesis of data through the 
                actions is part of the interaction. This process was also found to have to be goal orientated to
                achieve something specific and thus was included in the definition. Due to the implication of being 
                goal orientated interaction was described with the word “intent” meaning that the aim had a 
                specific idea in mind of what they were trying to achieve in this process. (Evanthia Dimara, 2020)

			</p>

			<p class = "blog1_text">
				For this definition, they also tried to be broad meaning that the interaction also happens between 
                different systems and things, and I found this interesting and very confusing as now the work varied 
                a lot, I thought defining this would be a lot simpler and could be done with less confusion. The 
                critical method they used in the reading I found to be a little bit unnecessary due to how this 
                method forces a lot of information into a simple definition were as I believe that the definition of 
                things is specific to the context which it is needed. I think that they did try to be specific by defining 
                what interaction means in terms of visualization. They broke down the process into its most basic 
                form which I thing was an excellent way \of defining the process of what interaction Is in 
                visualisation as they tried to make a definition that is meant to be accepted generally by all scientific 
                minds and do this method shows how they came to their conclusions and how they complied the 
                data for people to understand why they did and made decisions that steered the definition in a 
                specific direction.
			</p>
		
		
			<p class = "blog1_text">
				In the end I agree with the definition in its entirety and I can dispute that the accuracy of the 
                definitions leaves little to argue against but through this definition I still barely understand what is 
                trying to be said by the definitions and if I were to use this definition I feel as though I would need to 
                put a lot more effort and research to even know the context of what I am trying to refer to. This 
                definition has been compiled from a lot of great sources that increases its credibility quite high, but I 
                personally feel that the definition still lacks as it doesn’t communicate understanding to those that 
                read it and I feel like if a definition can communicate information about something so that the user 
                understands what it means then the definition falls short of its intention.
			</p>
		
		
			<p class = "blog1_text">
				Overall, I still like the process and line of thinki9ng, but I believe that definitions are meant to 
                communicate information and I believe that to truly communicate information and understanding of 
                that information a concept must be described in its most basic form.
